Backup of Jeremy Evers Fast Tracker II clone for the Gameboy Color called Fatass (https://jeremyevers.com/fatass/)

## From fatass.txt

I made fatass in 2000.  It's a badass fastracker clone for the gameboy color.  It was coded in straight z80.  The engine was used in several videogames.  Press select to get to the menu and from there you should be able to find help, or any other options you need.

Here's the source code.

Good luck!

Many years ago I made a Fast Tracker II clone for the Gameboy Color called Fatass. It was coded in pure z80 assembly, and was used to create music for several videogames.

I originally imagined myself writing entire albums with this thing on my travels.

You will need a gameboy color or gameboy advance emulator, or a flash system to use this.

Press select to get to the menu, from there you can access help, the file system, etc. Load some example tunes from rom to see what it can do. There’s even a version of a Big Brother song in there…
