# Fatass
Backup of Jeremy Evers Fast Tracker II clone for the Gameboy Color called Fatass (https://jeremyevers.com/fatass/)

## From fatass.txt

I made fatass in 2000.  It's a badass fastracker clone for the gameboy color.  It was coded in straight z80.  The engine was used in several videogames.  Press select to get to the menu and from there you should be able to find help, or any other options you need.

Here's the source code.

Good luck!
