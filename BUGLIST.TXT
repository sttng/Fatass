v0.14:	buglist

-global:

bugs:

	IT'S FUCKING CRAZY ON BW GB BECAUSE It USES $D000-$DFFF, BANKS THAT THE OLD
	GB DOES NOT HAVE!  ->PLAYER ONLY MODE ON GB?  ALSO: 	sprites in top left
	are not drawn correctly on real gameboy pocket-could be old version of fatass.
	-OK, AT SOME POINT i MUST CODE A PLAYER ONLY VERSION FOR GB, or possibly
	 edit in saveram? ouch...  tbat's asking for trouble...

	DOES NOT CHECK FOR things like not enough memory to load or do edit functions

features/additions:

	the isas version being used does not seem to compile ld x,($xx) as it used to,
	it is now compiling as ld x,($ffxx) - only in some cases, however. weird.
	-the cases it does it is when there is a variable name used instead of a direct
	 ld ($ffxx),a type statement.
	
	it's getting close to another clean-up/optimization pass - the main code bank
	is getting full, and some things are a bit slower than they need to be


-editor interface:

bugs:

-display:

	-waveform display is not perfect, it does not always trigger correctly
	 (eg missionc) and duration stuff is not implemented.

	; had a bug where the effects came up blank untill I did a copy track, even though
	; there were lots of things there. - randy had this happen once as well... ?!

	should recode ALL vram access to use a foolproof buffering method
	-sometimes palette write to vram is bad when switching in/out of menu

	had a bug where right after I turned it on, I went to the effects menu
	and it was mangled, everything was shifted vertically. bad variable init?
	
-audio:

	popping to menu from play means sound can get stuck on.

-editor:

	HMMM, SONGS WITH MACROS ARE BAD NEWS!!!!  THEY CAN CRASH THE INSERT NEW PATTERN
	FUNCTION, AND ALSO CAN PROBABLY MESS STUFF UP BAD IN PATTERN EDIT.  ON PATTERN
	EDIT, I SHOULD HAVE THEM PARSED AND REMOVED? I DUNNO.  FOR NOW NO MACROS, DAMNIT!


features/additions:

	MAKE TEXT SWITCHING NICER IN HELP MENU

 	stop cursor flash when thinking?

	need to tweak key repeat speeds

	add a way to change what track you are editing from within
	effects editor

	add a mute/solo command	thingy

	add are you sure to save over/delete

	add different cursor types

	ADD OPTIMZE MENU

	add paste track effects only
	add paste track notes only

	have it play the sample or draw the waveform on pressing B in effects menu when
	the cursor is over it?

	search and replace per channel for notes and/or effects parameters

	can have optimize use the music editor routines to remove redundant effects
	
-file access:

bugs:

	if you power off while working on saveram, it mangles it

features/additions:

	should add a "working" type display for when it is busy

	optimize could have the macro method added sometime - BUT macros are bad news
	right now!!!!


-plasma screen:

	add a logo with dybp fill?

-player:

bugs:

	find out why changing the volume restarts the envelope
	find out why changing the evelope restarts the envelope

	find out why autopanner clicks so damned loud - MAKE IT SO THAT IT WRITES GLOBAL
	REGS ONLY ONCE PER PLAYER TICK!

	find out why you have to restart envelope after changing waveforms

	find out why it eats so much raster time on switching patterns, ie moving on to
	the next one

features/additions:

	definitely add the track loop too thingy in the sequence

	add a byte for player call rate->1/2 1/1 2/1, etc.

	add $80 more gain shaper thingies
